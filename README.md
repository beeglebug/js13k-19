## post mortem

#### summary

raycaster was the plan
knew i wanted sound
dont leave all the content to the end
use all the space

### technical details

raycasting
maze generation
pathfinding
rng
stateless ai

#### minification

gulp
terser
advzip
manual golfing was a waste
compress multiple images into one

#### what went well

learned loads
first time sound
play testing and feedback
accessibility (controls/mouse sensitivity)
stats and achievements (last minute addition)

#### what could have gone better

wasted time on dead ends (name gen)
would have liked more variety
terser mangle properties
could compress images more
animation

#### conclusion

twitter was fun (notch likes)
had fun, but worked a bit too much on it
dont over think the compression until you need to
